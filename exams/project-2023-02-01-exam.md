# Deep Learning Project - February 2023: Image inpainting over CIFAR-10

The purpose of this project is to build and train a neural network for image
inpainting over the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Inpainting is a restauration process where damaged, deteriorated, or missing
parts of an artwork are filled in to present a complete image.

In our case, we create the portion of the image to be filled in by cropping a
fixed size rectangular area from CIFAR-10 images.

The networks must be trained over the training set, and tested on the test set.
You can split the train set into a validation set, if you wish.

The metrics that will be used to evaluate you result is Mean Square Error.

The definition of the crop, facilities to create the dataset, and more details
about the project can be found in the companion notebook.

Good work!
