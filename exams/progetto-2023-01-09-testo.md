# Polar Express

The purpose of the project is to learn the mapping from polar coordinates to a
discrete 10x10 grid of cells in the plane, using a neural network.

The supervised dataset is given to you in the companion notebook, in the form of
a generator (to be considered as a black box).

The model MUST achieve an accuracy of 95%. This is a necessary condition, but it
does not influence the evaluation in other ways.

Instead, your model will be evaluated in a way inversely proportional to the
number of its parameters: the smaller, the better.

WARNING: Any solution taking advantage (in a direct or indirect way) of
meta-knowledge about the generator will be automatically rejected.
